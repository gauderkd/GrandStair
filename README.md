# GrandStair
Experiment using a two up, one down version of the staircase method.
Stimuli are midi files separated into different folders by Block number input through a GUI at the beggining of the experiment.

TODO: There is no consistant way of dealing with hitting either the roof or the bottom of the staircase (when participant is too good or too impaired and goes beyond the stimuli available). This experiment sets the boundary but allows the experiment to continue.
